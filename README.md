# who, me?
hiiiiii~

I'm into math and etymology and unicode... basically pedantry is my hobby.
I'm also into other things that are more difficult to justify cracking open a git repo about!

I'm not really into websites. I gave it a good try.

I go by is!

# hmmmm?

I have a [website](yours.is) with an excellent url. I put writing there for now, it's okay! It's fresh!

Please install my [plugin for vim](https://github.com/izzergh/rumpelstiltskin) and tell me if it breaks or sucks, or even if it slaps.
